GMT makes no guarantees regarding completeness, accuracy, or fitness for any particular purpose.\nStop-level boarding estimates and other inferred values are subject to methodological limitations and should be interpreted with care. The data may not be suitable for detailed operational, financial, or regulatory reporting without additional validation.\nDatasets are typically published within one month of the close of each reporting period. Substantive revisions to previously published data will be documented in the project changelog."
